			Really, we're only uncomfortable when an overwhelming majority of shapes around us are different.
			I mean, we don't run screaming, we're not shapist or anything, but it's tough when you have nothing
			in common with most of the shapes around you. Given the opportunity to move somewhere else, well,
			I speak for us all when I say we'd rather be in a 50/50 sort of situation.

			Being in the minority is fine. If it's 60/40, I can handle that!
			Better than being in a boring neighborhood of all triangles!
			And all shapes are basically the same.
			We only want to move if less than a third (33%) of our neighbors are like us.

			Well, sometimes a neighborhood just becomes a square neighborhood,

			What is up with that? These are good shapes, nice shapes.

			But if you start with a new random board, at 0% bias, things look pretty good.
			You might think simply having completely unbiased polygons would fix our segregation problems.

			Of course, the real polygon world doesn't start anew with a random shuffling of shapes every day.

			All it takes is a change in the perception of what an acceptable environment looks like.
			So, fellow shapes, remember it's not about triangles vs squares,

			It's about deciding what we want the world to look like, and accepting no less.

			Play around! Notice, for example, that it's difficult to maintain a bias much higher than 50% when
			living in close quarters to other shapes, but that sparsely-populated shapelands
