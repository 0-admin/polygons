			<strong>Y'know, it's tough being a triangle in a square world.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sure, most squares are glad you're around. But it's never quite comfortable.
			Speaking as a triangle, I'd much rather be around both triangles and squares!

			I'm not biased against squares.
			<span cartoon="i_like_squares.png">I hang out with lots of squares!</span>
			Like all shapes, I'm really only uncomfortable when an overwhelming majority of the shapes around me are different.
			I mean, I don't run screaming, I'm not shapist or anything, but given the opportunity to move,
			I think we'd all rather be in a 50/50 sort of situation.

		<p>
			50/50 is pretty ideal for all shapes in shapeland, and if it's 60/40 and I'm in the minority,
			well, I don't mind! Better than being in a boring neighborhood of all triangles!
			All shapes are basically the same. We only want to move if less than a third (33%)
			of our neighbors are like us. If that's bias, well,
			<span cartoon="fifty_fifty.png">surely it's a minor one.</span>
		</p>

			If everyone were as unbiased as I was, wouldn't everything be fine?

			The result is inevitable. Clearly visible separation, with many shapes having little to no contact with other kinds of shapes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, sometimes a neighborhood just becomes a square neighborhood,
			and it's not their fault if no triangles seem to want to stick around.
			And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but

			Even with little <i>individual</i> bias, you can end up with massive <i>institutional</i> bias.

			Equality is an unstable equilibrium. It breaks at the slightest disturbance.
			Perhaps we could teach shapes to have less bias.
			Perhaps it's wrong of me to notice when I'm surrounded by squares,
			and wrong that squares who visit our triangle-dominated areas never seem to want to stay.
			What if we could teach all shapes to have zero preference for the shape of their neighbors?

			It might seem reasonable for a shape to prefer not being in the minority!
			Yet compared to 33%, where there's at least the potential for a happy shapeland,

			And when a shape's bias gets too high,
			<span cartoon="moved.png">it gets tough to be comfortable anywhere.</span>
			That's not fun for anybody! 
 			Maybe we really do need a world with no bias.
			In a new and random world, full of shapes who don't see shapes, who are
			<span cartoon="real_shapist.png">shape-blind</span>,
			completely accepting of all, well, everyone is a lot happier!
			Of course, the polygon world doesn't start anew every morning with all of us

			relatively stable with certain shape-dominated spaces created by
			<span cartoon="past.png">past bias</span>.

			All it takes is a change in the perception of what an acceptable environment looks like.
			So, fellow shapes, remember it's not about triangles vs squares, and it's not about bias 
			against shapes that don't look like you. It's about deciding what we want the world to look like,
			and though we occasionally have to accept less, we never have to settle for it.

				Thank you for playing this blog post!

			<br>
			<div style="font-size:16px; line-height:18px">

				Our cute, adorable segregation simulator is based off the work of Nobel Prize-winning game theorist,
				Thomas Schelling. Specifically, his mathematical model of bias found in
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf">
				Dynamic Models of Segregation.</a>
				We built on top of his model, by showing how adding a small cultural demand for diversity can help
				desegregate a neighbourhood. In other words, we gave his model a happy ending.

				<br><br>

				Schelling's model is a convincing demonstration of how
				<span cartoon="hat.jpg">innocent-seeming</span> rules
				can create very undesirable outcomes, but of course real-life situations are more complicated.
				You might enjoy taking a closer look at real data in reference to Schelling's model.
				W.A.V. Clark's 1991 paper <a target="_blank" href="http://smg.media.mit.edu/library/Clark.ResidentialSegregation.pdf">
				Residential Preferences and Neighborhood Racial Segregation: A Test of the Schelling Segregation Model</a>
				has a lot of interesting data in it.

				<br><br>

				Schelling's model explores one small aspect of how tiny bias can have large accumulative effects,
				but there's other models that focus on other aspects.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lane/papers/male_female.pdf">
				Male-Female Differences: A Computer Simulation</a>
				shows how extremely small differences in the perception of men and women's work can have huge effects.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html">
				The Petrie Multiplier</a>
				explores how small negative actions of
				<span cartoon="not_all_triangles.jpg">a few bad apples</span>
				can become multiplied by certain situations.

				<br><br>

				The takeaway from our variant of Schelling's simulator is that demanding a single bit of diversity
				in your spaces makes a huge difference overall. For a real-world application of this idea,
				see <a target="_blank" href="http://plzdiversifyyourpanel.tumblr.com/">Plz Diversify Your Panel</a>,
				an initiative where overrepresented speakers refuse invitations
				to speak on panels that don't include diverse representation.

				<br><br>

				The format of this playable post was inspired by Bret Victor's work on 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">
				Explorable Explanations</a> and Ian Bogost's work on 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://bogost.com/books/persuasive_games/">
				procedural rhetoric</a>.
