		<p><strong>These are the adorable polygon people.</strong></p>
		<p>
			They're 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly biased against each other.
			Emphasis on the word <i>slightly</i>.
			In fact, every polygon would prefer to be part of a diverse crowd of shapes:
		</p>

		<iframe playable src="play/mini/mini_dragging.html" width="710" height="360" scrolling="no" style="margin:0 auto;display:block" embedded></iframe>

		<p>
			These polygons are so unbiased that they even like it when a slight majority of shapes
			around them are different from them. In fact, the only problem these polygons have is
			if an overwhelming majority of shapes around them are different.
			I mean, they don't run screaming, because they're not shapist or anything,
			but they do notice, and given the opportunity to move somewhere else, they will. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<div style="width:470px; float:left">
			In this example, most polygons are good where they are, but the triangle in the middle
			is willing to move, and you can click and drag to relocate it to a location where it will
			be happier. Not that it can't handle having five squares and only one triangle as neighbors,
			but why not go somewhere where its neighbors are 50% triangles and 50% squares?
			That seems more equal!

		<div style="clear:both"></div>

		<p>
			So with just that one rule, that if under 1/3rd of a shape's neighbors are like them
			they'd prefer to move, what happens to a large shape society?	
		</p>
		<p>
			On the following board, you can move any unhappy shape to a new location.
			Happy shapes obviously don't want to move, and bored shapes are risk-averse
			and would also rather stay where they are. The bored shapes would like it if
			you'd move a differently-shaped polygon into their neighborhood, though!
		</p>

		<p><strong>Try relocating unhappy shapes until the entire shape society is stable:</strong></p>

		<p><strong>And the result... near-complete segregation.</strong></p>
		<p>
			Well, sometimes a neighborhood just becomes a square neighborhood,
			and it's not their fault if no triangles seem to want to stick around.
			And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square,
			but they can't help it if squares aren't interested.

			Here's a larger simulation, where you can still move shapes by hand,
			or let unhappy shapes automatically move towards more comfortable locations.
			You can also see a graph that measures, on average,
			what percentage of a polygon's neighbors are like themselves.

			What is up with that? These are good shapes, nice shapes.
			So why is it that even when every individual seems like a model citizen,
			with just a slight preference to move only if they're overwhelmingly surrounded
			by shapes unlike them, why does shape life end up so boring?
		</p>
		<p>
			Even when there's no evidence of individual bias,
			you can still end up with institutional segregation.
			So what is a shape society to do? 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the next example, you can change the bias:

		<p>
			Notice how much more segregated things get when you increase the bias beyond 1/3.
			What if shapes were only unhappy if less than half of their neighbors were like them?
			It might seem reasonable for a shape to prefer not being in the minority!
		</p>
		<p>
			But starting with a new random board, with 0 bias, things are pretty good.
			You might think being able to have completely unbiased polygons would fix our segregation problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, the real polygon world doesn't start anew with a random shuffling of polygons every day.
			In the following example, the world starts off stable and segregated, rather than random,
			but you can still decrease the bias to zero and see what happens.

			Things don't get better. In the above models, things can only ever stay the same or get worse.
			Even when every single shape citizen is the definition of unbiased.
		</p>
		<p><strong>In a world where bias ever existed, being unbiased isn't enough!</strong><p>
		<p>
			We need to expect more of our shapes. But what can they do? 
		</p>
		<p>
			As long as forcing shapes to bend to the will of a benevolent dictator isn't an option,
			what we need is a cultural change, one where individuals choose to behave slightly differently
			than they did before. A tiny change in behavior can make huge changes on the resulting shape society.

			You know, I hear that hanging out only with similar shapes is not just boring,
			but like, really super boring. All the cool shapes are nonconformists.
			Yes, if other shapes are too similar to them, the hippest of squares seek more triangles,
			and the awesomest triangles seek out squares!

			It's not enough to have no bias against other shapes, but tiny individual decisions
			not to accept non-diverse spaces makes a huge difference for Shapeland.
			All it takes is a change in the perception of what an acceptable environment looks like.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, fellow shapes, remember it's not about triangles vs squares,
			and it's not about bias against shapes that don't look like you.
			It's about deciding what we want the world to look like, and accepting no less,
			even if it means occasionally giving up a cozy spot to make room for someone else.
