		<p><strong>These are the adorable Polygon People.</strong></p>
		<p>They're 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly biased.</p>
		<p>
			Emphasis on the word slightly. Every individual polygon is ok with having a
			mix of different polygons around them. In fact, they prefer that.
			A shape is happiest when they're part of a diverse crowd of shapes.
		</p>

		<p>
			You'd think these polygons would be the paragon of unbiasedness.
			They like diversity, they prefer diversity, they even like if a slight majority
			of shapes around them are different from them. In fact, the only problem these
			polygons have is if an overwhelming majority of shapes around them are unlike them.
			I mean, they don't run screaming, because they're not shapist or anything,
			but they do notice, and given the opportunity to move somewhere else, they will.
		</p>

		<p>
			So with just that one rule, that if under 1/3rd of a shape's neighbors are like
			them they'd prefer to move, what happens to a large shape society?
		</p>

		<p>
			On the following board, you can move any unhappy shape to a new location.
			Happy shapes obviously don't want to move, and bored shapes are risk-averse
			and would also rather stay where they are. The bored shapes would like it if
			you'd move a differently-shaped polygon into their neighborhood, though!
		</p>

		<p><strong>Try relocating unhappy shapes until the entire shape society is stable:</strong></p>

		<p><strong>And the result... near-complete segregation.</strong></p>
		<p>
			This wasn't a fluke. You can run this process over and over again with different boards,
			and you'll always see an emerging pattern where similar shapes group together.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's a larger simulation, where you can still move shapes by hand, or press a button
			to let unhappy shapes automatically move towards happier locations. You can also see a
			graph that measures, on average, what percentage of a polygon's neighbors are like themselves.

		<p>
			Why does this happen? The shapes individually prefer an integrated shape society,
			and no shape is individually biased against any other individual shape.
			So why is it that even when every individual seems like a model citizen,
			with just a slight preference to move only if they're overwhelmingly surrounded
			by shapes unlike them, why isn't this enough?
		</p>
		<p>
			In the next example, you can change the bias. Polygons are happy as long
			as the bias% of neighbors, or more, are like themselves. You can even turn
			the bias all the way down to 0%, so that the shapes are happy to be neighbors
			with all completely different shapes, with 0% other shapes like them!

	<div class="chapter">
		<p>
			Notice how much more segregated things get when you increase the bias beyond 1/3.
			What if shapes were only unhappy if less than half of their neighbors were like them?
			It might seem reasonable for a shape to prefer not being in the minority!
		</p>
		<p>
			But starting with a new random board, with 0 bias, things are pretty good!
			You might think being able to have completely unbiased polygons would fix our segregation problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, the real polygon world doesn't start anew with a random shuffling
			of polygons every day. In the following example, the world starts off stable and segregated,
			rather than random, but you can still decrease the bias to zero and see what happens.

			Things don't get better. In the above models, things can only ever stay the same or get worse.
			Even when every single shape citizen is the definition of unbiased.
		</p>
		<p><strong>In a world where bias ever existed, being unbiased isn't enough!</strong><p>
		<p>
			We need to expect more of our shapes. But what can they do? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Forcing shapes to bend to the will of a benevolent dictator, and planning a fully integrated society,
			would be good for the happiness of all in theory, but in practice infringes on the rights of
			individual shapes who don't want to be forced out of their homes. What we need is a cultural change,
			one where individuals choose to behave slightly differently than they did before.
			Changing culture so that individuals have slightly different motivations can make huge changes
			on the resulting shape society.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the next example, cultural change has introduced a nonconformity bias.
			Bored shapes are no longer too comfortable to move, but actually feel uncomfortable
			if there's too many similar shapes nearby!
