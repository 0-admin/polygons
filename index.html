<div id="title">THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD</div>

<div id="essay">

	<p>
		<b>These are the adorable Polygon People.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		They're 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly biased against each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		// I'm not Shapist, some of my best friends are Squares!
	</p>
	<p>
		Emphasis on the word *slightly*.
		A Polygon would be happy with an even 50/50 split of neighbours of different types,
		but <b>if less than 33% of their neighbours are like them, they will be unhappy</b>, and want to move somewhere else.
	</p>
	<p>
		// I don't hate Triangles, I just that some biological differences matter...
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep that in mind.
		<i>Every single Polygon would be happy with a fully integrated neighbourhood.</i>
		However, let's see what happens over time... 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Click and drag unhappy Polygons to a random empty square.
		<br>
		Repeat until all Polygons are happy.</b>
	</p>

	<br><hr><br>

	<p>
		And the result... near-complete segregation.
	</p>
	<p>
		This wasn't just a fluke. You can run this process over and over again with different boards,
		and it will almost always tend towards a highly segregated outcome.
	</p>
	<p>
		Try it yourself! This next interactive bit automates the Polygons moving around,
		and measures the average % of a Polygon's neighbours that are the same shape.
		We'll call this the Sameness %.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because it's random at first, the Sameness % will usually start at around 50%.
		But let's see what happens, what almost always happens, once they start moving around.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Click GO to start the simulation.<br>
		Click RESET to create a new *random* board of Triangles and Squares.</b>
	</p>

	<br><hr><br>

	<p>
		- The system is bad, even if the agents are good.<br>
		- Institutional Shapism vs Individual Shapism.<br>
		- An attack on sexism != An attack on men.<br>
		? Tragedy of the Commons - personal benefit of your biases vs global stagnation over sameness?<br>
		- "Don't hate the player, hate the game"?
	</p>
	<p>
		Right now, the "unhappy" threshold for self-similar neighbours is at 33%.
		Let's call this the Bias %.
		Now, play around with the Bias %, and see what level of Sameness % this results in at the end.
	</p>

	<br><hr><br>

	<p>
		- Small biases can lead to large segregation. <br>
		- Too large of a bias, and you won't even have a stable outcome.<br>
		- This is Thomas Schelling's depressing discovery<br>
		- Applies not just to racial segregation in major cities, but also women in STEM.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you may be thinking, well then the solution to desegregation is obvious, right?
		Just turn the bias all the way down to zero?
		Alas, in real life, we are *not* starting out on a randomly distributed board.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a simulation where the board starts off very segregated - see what happens when you adjust the Bias %.
	</p>

	<br><hr><br>

	<p>
		As you can see, nothing happens.
		In fact, it can get even *more* segregated if you turn the Bias % upwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		- Equality is not an equilibrium.<br>
		- You need active measures. (I used to believe we didn't, Schelling changed my mind?)<br>
		- Being a "good" person is like being a "clean" person - it takes effort.
	</p>
	<p>
		New rule: Polygons are now *also* unhappy if *too many* of their neighbours are exactly like them.
		Let's call this the Conformity %.
		This next simulation starts with a segregated neighbourhood, and all Polygons at 20% Bias and 90% Conformity.
	</p>

	<p>
		- Top-down approaches are ineffective and hard to implement.<br>
		- An effective bottom-up approach to re-integration.<br>
		- The personal benefits of diversity in your social circles/workplace/conferences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, A FULL SANDBOX SIMULATION: bring the neighbourhood to segregation and back to equality.
	</p>

	<p>
		- Summary of lessons<br>
		- Cautiously optimistic conclusion<br>
		- Some concrete call to actions on sharing this message, and tips to improving the diversity in their conferences/workplace/social circles.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just for kicks, letting you drag Polygons anywhere and everywhere.

	The Outline I'm Thinking Of:
	1. Manual Schelling Sim - the player acts out the algorithm
	2. First Lesson - small biases can lead to large segregation. The system is bad, even if the agents are good.
	3. Automatic Schelling Sim - the player can see what level of segregation results from what bias %
	4. Second Lesson - how this applies not just to racial segregation in major cities, but also women in STEM.
	5. Starts Segregated - a sim starts out segregated. Even if you reduce bias to zero, it'll stay segregated.
	5. Third Lesson - Equality is not an equilibrium. We need active measures.
	6. Non-Conformity Sim - agents now also move if too many of their neighbours are like them.
	7. Fourth Lesson - A bottom-up approach to social integration
	8. Summary of lessons
	9. Cautiously optimistic conclusion
	10. Some concrete call to actions on sharing this message, and tips to improving the diversity in their conferences/workplace/social circles.
	11. Creative Commons Zero - use in education/videos/remix into infographics &amp; share with us
