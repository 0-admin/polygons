		<p><strong>These are the adorable Polygon People.</strong></p>
		<p>They're 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly biased against each other.</p>
		<p>
			Emphasis on the word slightly. A Polygon would be okay with an even 50/50 split of
			neighbours of different types, but if less than 33% of their neighbours are like them,
			they will be unhappy, and want to move somewhere else.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep that in mind. Every single Polygon would be okay with a fully integrated neighbourhood.
			However, let's see what happens over time...

		<p>And the result... near-complete segregation.</p>
		<p>
			This wasn't just a fluke. You can run this process over and over again with different boards,
			and it will almost always tend towards a highly segregated outcome.
		</p>
		<p>
			Try it yourself! This next interactive bit automates the Polygons moving around,
			and measures the average % of a Polygon's neighbours that are the same shape.
			We'll call this the Sameness %.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because it's random at first, the Sameness % will usually start at around 50%.
			But let's see what happens, what almost always happens, once they start moving around.
