		<p><strong>These are the adorable polygon people.</strong></p>

			They're 50% Triangles, 50% Squares, and 100% slightly biased.

			Emphasis on the word <i>slightly</i>.
			In fact, every polygon would prefer to be part of a diverse crowd of shapes:

		<p>
			They're only uncomfortable if an overwhelming majority of shapes around them are different.
			I mean, they don't run screaming, because they're not shapist or anything,
			but given the opportunity to move somewhere else, they will.

			So here's the deal. Shapes will <i>only</i> want to move if less than a third (33%) of their neighbors are like them.
			They'd all be fine with a 50-50 neighbor split!
			But with that one rule, what actually happens to a large shape society?

		<p>And the result... near-complete segregation.</p>
		<p>
			Well, sometimes a neighborhood just becomes a square neighborhood,
			and it's not their fault if no triangles seem to want to stick around.
			And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square,
			but they can't help it if squares aren't interested.

			What is up with that? These are good shapes, nice shapes.
			So why is it that even when every individual seems like a model citizen,
			with just a slight preference to move only if they're overwhelmingly surrounded
			by shapes unlike them, why does shape life end up so boring?

			Even with little <i>individual</i> bias, you can end up with massive <i>institutional</i> bias.

			Equality is not an equilibrium. It's unstable, and tends towards segregation.
			So what is a shape society to do? What if the shapes had a lower individual bias, or maybe higher?

			Notice how much more segregated things get when you increase the bias beyond 33%.
			What if shapes were unhappy if less than 50% of their neighbors were like them?

			But if you start with a new random board, at 0% bias, things look pretty good.
			You might think simply having completely unbiased polygons would fix our segregation problems.

			Of course, the real polygon world doesn't start anew with a random shuffling of shapes every day.

		<p><strong>In a world where bias ever existed, being unbiased isn't enough!</strong><p>

			Hm... y'know, I hear that hanging out only with similar shapes is like, really super boring.
			All the cool shapes are nonconformists.
			Yes, if other shapes are too similar to them, the hippest of squares seek more triangles,

			All it takes is a change in the perception of what an acceptable environment looks like.
			So, fellow shapes, remember it's not about triangles vs squares,
			and it's not about bias against shapes that don't look like you.
			It's about deciding what we want the world to look like, and accepting no less.
